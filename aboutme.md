I'm glad you found your way to my website!

This site is still under construction so please look out for updates!


### So who am I really?

Born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden and currently working for [Avaus](http://www.avaus.fi/) as an analyst. I really do enjoy my work and dwell in the ares of data science and machine learning. Curiousity is what drives me and I have definitely chosen to tight area to work in where I will always find more topics such as methods for modelling and more to explore.

I am a daily R user and I try to learn something new in R every day and create best practise. I am slowly learning shiny and I will in due time share my work (not much to share at the moment I'm afraid)
